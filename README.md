# RAG

 Legal RAG Assistant | 🐍 Python + 🧠 LangChain
AI-Powered Legal Intelligence Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
“Revolutionizing legal research and contract review with smart AI systems”

📘 Project Summary
This initiative introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to enhance the interpretation and analysis of legal documents. Leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) and efficient retrieval methods, it supports smarter analysis of NDAs, contracts, merger and acquisition agreements, and privacy policies — improving both speed and accuracy in legal workflows.

💼 Value Proposition
The Legal RAG Assistant offers substantial benefits for legal professionals and businesses:

⚡ Accelerated Legal Research – Instantly find case laws, clauses, and legal statutes

📜 AI-Driven Contract Review – Identify terms, obligations, and potential risks

📈 Regulatory Compliance Monitoring – Detect updates in policy and legislation

🧠 Smarter Legal Decisions – Generate informed, context-sensitive answers

📂 Legal Dataset Sources
This system uses real-world legal datasets curated for accuracy and relevance:

| Dataset       | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `contractnli` | Non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements |
| `cuad`        | Contracts annotated with legal clauses        |
| `maud`        | M\&A agreements and deal documents            |
| `privacy_qa`  | Privacy policy-based Q\&A pairs               |
